# Introduction

## Basic info

This is first public version of this **API**.

Kevin's api is organized around **REST**.

For presentation purposes we will use the base URL as:
```
https://kevin.com/api
```

**NOTE:** Final URL will differ.

Please, report to me if you find a bug! :bug:

## API Levels

API consists of three level of access:
* Root level
* Public level
* Company level

**Root level** allows to add and delete companies. It can also set API public key for clients to autenticate. It is not supposed to have GUI. It is designed to be used by company that hosts API and wants root access.

**Public level** is an access level for client apps (game distributed to many platforms). It is used for sending selected questions for quiz and reciving data about answers. In order to make sure only trusted clients can use api, "*PublicKey*" is required to connect. It is also usefull to forbid older versions of client apps from connecting to the API. Public level request must include statment showed below:

```json
{
	"publicKey": "testKey"
}
```

**Company Level** is the most advanced of all layers. It uses JWT cookie to authenticate clients. It is designed for administration of a single client company account. It allows to manage questions and see telemetry data gathered from answered questions.

### Errors

How API handles errors?

Every error has specific message that will further explain a problem.

**Errors table:**

| **Error** | **Code** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | Success | Everything went well |
| 404 | Not Found | No such route |
| 403 | Forbidden | Permission denied |
| 400 | syntax error | Something is wrong with .json (message will specify) |
| 500 | Server error | Cannot process something (message will specify) |

**Error example:**

```json
{
	"error": "403",
	"message": "Access Denied"
}
```

```
https://kevin.com/api/answer
```

}

```

In order to submit an answer about question qou need to provide its QID (Question ID) and array of selected options by user in order as provided in .json from quiz request.

There were two options:

```json
"Options": [
				[
					"Option 1",
					true
				],
				[
					"Option 2",

				]
		]

So submited array of options looks like: "options": [false, true]. That means that user selected "Option 2" as an answer.
